## Overview
PLANMYTRIP is a fictitious top travel technology company that specializes in internet-related services in the hotel and lodging industry. I've been asked to collect and present data for customers via the search page, which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel, anywhere in the world. Additionally, I will perform statistical analysis on weather data in the Northern and Southern hemispher to help my team predict the best time for year for people to plan their vacation(s).

Completed Tasks:
- Used Jupyter Notebook and the CitiPy module to find cities for 500+ random 
latitudes and longitudes
- Performed requests on the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieved the JSON weather data from 500+ cities
- Uses Matplotlib to create a series of scatter plots showing the relationship between latitude and a variety of weather parameters for over 500 cities around the world
- Performed statistuical calculations using linear regression on the weather parameters in the Northern and Southern hemispheres
- Exported, cleaned, and used weather data to choose best cities for vacation based on specified weather criteria
- Mapped cities using GeoViews and Geoapify API
